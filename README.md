# Recognizing_Python

<p>The goal of this assignment is for you to use your knowledge of programming concepts and identify them in a new language.  There are two code snippets provided below.  One is a list of programming concepts, and the other is some Python code.  In the Python file, <i>file.py</i>, write a comment in the same line of the code with the corresponding concept from the <i>file.txt</i> file.</p>

Comments can made with either a <b>#</b> (single line) or triple set of <b>"""</b> (multiline) at the beginning and the end of the comment.

<p>Below is an example of the expected output. If there is more than one concept that is covered on the same line, add them both.</p>

<p>Remember to only use what you already know. If you don't know, this is a great opportunity to utilize the 20 min rule and ask a fellow cohort mate. All of these concepts will be explained in the modules to follow.</p>

The files can be downloaded here.
